#### i made a project

# 21 number Game python

- i got this idea from geekforgeeks, like they got source code that 21_number game and i rewrote it until i remember *evry code in the project* and thought to myself what im doing

- so instead coping the game and rewrote it, i made my own

- you can see check  geekforgeeks source code looks like: 
           url:'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/21-number-game-in-python/'
- My Game {
     i just come up with function to gen num for computer with start from the   last element in the xyz list and gen nums in range(1,7)

}

- first i wrote simple code as always, becuse its the best way to go to complexcity

- and then wrote it with some Dope OOP CODE

TODO:
    now im just gonna upload to github, and then wrote test codes and will uplad
